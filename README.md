# Amazon data scraper
A basic Amazon data scraper that automatically creates a CSV file containing all gathered information.

To use, simply alter the url variable with a search url of your choice. By default the scraper will use an Amazon earbud search.

There is a minor bug with pricing - if the price is displayed as "$value$value" the discounted price and RRP are being dispslayed together.
